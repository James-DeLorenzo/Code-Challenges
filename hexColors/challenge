Given three integers between 0 and 255, corresponding to the red, green, and blue channel values of a color, find the hex string for that color.
You may use anything built into your programming language, such as for base conversion, but you can also do it manually.

Optional bonus: color blending
Given a list of hex color strings, produce the hex color string you get from averaging their RGB values together.
You'll need to round channel values to integers.
